            "description": "Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, better known simply as Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), is a novel by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the \"travellers' tales\" literary sub-genre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\" [1] Since then, it has never been out of print. Cavehill in Belfast is thought to be the inspiration for the novel. Swift imagined that the mountain resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city. [2]",

            "description": "Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver. <br /><br />Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals.<br /><br />On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zoë, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zoë at his side. Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man. <br /><br />A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life . . . as only a dog could tell it.",

By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, better known simply as Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), is a novel by Anglo-Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the \"travellers' tales\" literary sub-genre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\"[1] Since then, it has never been out of print.",

A nice easy Simple Guide to show the path Taylor took to success. The early days singing at a Philly's game to singing to over 100,000 people at the Gillette Stadium. Moving closer to Nashville to make the regular trips easier for this budding new artist. Understanding where Taylor gets her ideas for her songs from will help you understand the meaning behind them. Like most young women, Taylor has friends, favorite things to do and has had a few boyfriends that she does write about, if she feels strongly about it. The truth about a person is shown by what they do, not by something written by someone else or something they say. Taylor donates to causes close to her heart and has a strong bond with her fans, it's thanks to them she can be so generous. Read the book, enjoy her story and go and create yours.",

For almost all of those years she has been the clandestine lover to Paul Sheringham, young heir of a neighboring house. The two now meet on an unseasonably warm March day—Mothering Sunday—a day that will change Jane’s life forever. <br /> &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; <br />As the narrative moves back and forth from 1924 to the end of the century, what we know and understand about Jane—about the way she loves, thinks, feels, sees, remembers—expands with every vividly captured moment. Her story is one of profound self-discovery, and through her, Graham Swift has created an emotionally soaring, deeply affecting work of fiction.",

            "description": "<b>An insightful, inspiring, “candid and warm” (<i>Booklist</i>) memoir from Karamo Brown—beloved culture expert from Netflix’s <i>Queer Eye</i>—as he shares his story for the first time, exploring how the challenges in his own life have allowed him to forever transform the lives of those in need.</b><br /><br />When Karamo Brown first auditioned for the casting directors of <i>Queer Eye</i>, he knew he wouldn’t win the role of culture expert by discussing art and theater. Instead he decided to redefine what “culture” could—and <i>should</i>—mean for the show. He took a risk and declared, “I am culture.”<br /><br />After all, Karamo believes culture is how people feel about themselves and others, how they relate to the world around them, and how their shared labels, burdens, and experiences affect their daily lives in ways both subtle and profound. Seen through this lens, Karamo <i>is</i> culture: his family is Jamaican and Cuban; he was raised in the South in predominantly white neighborhoods and attended an HBCU (Historically Black College/University); he was trained as a social worker and psychotherapist; he overcame personal issues of colorism, physical and emotional abuse, alcohol and drug addiction, and public infamy; he is a proud and dedicated gay single father of two boys, one biological and one adopted.<br /><br />In “this soul-soothing memoir” (<i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i>), Karamo reflects on his lifelong education. It comprises every adversity he has overcome, as well as the lessons he has learned along the way. It is only by exploring our difficulties and having the hard conversations—with ourselves and one another—that we are able to adjust our mind-sets, heal emotionally, and move forward to live our best lives.<br /><br />“During every episode of <i>Queer Eye</i>, there’s at least one touching moment where Karamo Brown drops some serious wisdom about self-love and makes everybody cry. His moving memoir about overcoming adversity captures that feeling in book form” (<i>HelloGiggles</i>).",

Jefferson Parker, Roland Ford is hunting down a mysterious killer, jockeying for position with the FBI, and risking everything to save a friend in terrible jeopardy.</b><br /><br />Returning hero and private investigator Roland Ford is on the trail of a mysterious killer who is beheading CIA drone operators and leaving puzzling clues at each crime scene. His troubled friend Lindsay Rakes is afraid for her own life and the life of her son after a fellow flight crew member is killed in brutal fashion. Even more terrifying is the odd note the killer left behind: \"Welcome to Caliphornia. This is not the last.\" Ford strikes an uneasy alliance with San Diego-based FBI agent Joan Taucher, who is tough as nails but haunted by what she sees as the Bureau's failure to catch the 9/11 terrorists, many of whom spent their last days in her city. As the killer strikes again, Ford and Taucher dash into the fray, each desperate for their own reasons--each ready to risk it all to stop the killer from doing far more damage.",

Events so shaped themselves that Andy Foger was glad to loan Tom the Red Streak in which to search for the stolen Arrow, and it was in the later craft that Tom, his father and Ned Newton had a most thrilling adventure. They were on their way down the lake when, in the air overhead they saw a balloon on fire, with a man clinging to the trapeze. They managed to save the fellow's life, after a strenuous endeavor. The balloonist, John Sharp, was destined to play quite a part in Tom's life. Mr. Sharp was more than an aeronaut - he was the inventor of an airship - that is, he had plans drawn for the more important parts, but he had struck a snag of clouds, as he expressed it, and could not make.",

            "description": "You have all (no doubt) read the countless stories of the Roswell saucer crash in 1947. The truth is you probably bought this book because the title contained the name of that once sleepy little town lost in the desert of Chaves County, New Mexico. If you’re like me, you grab at every chance to garner as much new information about that day in July (and the important days and years thereafter) trying to squeeze as much truth as is possible from the falsehoods that have been perpetrated by our government in their efforts to keep that very truth from you.<br /><br />Please rest assured, I will not bore you by rehashing the stories you have already heard. This is not another Roswell book per se; for there will be no mention of the Roswell rancher and the tale of what he found on his property. Nor will you find pages of repeated dialog from witnesses (military or civilian) about the pieces of debris and its unusual properties. You will not hear again: the story of the grey creatures; their autopsy; testimony from Officers (or their children) as to what they saw, heard or knew.<br />What you will read (in the pages that follow) is the story developed from testimony given to me by a long retired Air Force pilot whom I befriended many years ago while we participated in a mutual hobby. This was a solid, God fearing man (military to the core) but, he was a man with a burning need within, to tell his story before he passed on.<br /><br />I am not quite sure why he chose me as his confessor, for there was a great disparity in our ages. Perhaps it was that he saw a copy or two of the many books on UFOs that were constantly littering my desk in my shop. Whatever the reason, he sat me down early one Saturday morning in a secluded hangar at the local airport and began a one sided verbal journey that wouldn’t end until late in the evening-hours of the following day.<br /><br />His hands shook and his voice cracked as he forced himself to break the vows he had taken as an officer in the service of his country. He was risking (in his mind, for he was well indoctrinated) being thrown into prison and losing what little time and retirement pension he and his wife had left. I could tell that this bothered him greatly and I asked him several times if he would rather stop.<br /><br />“No, No, just let me finish,” he would reply. “Someone has to tell this story. I have to tell this story.” And then he would whisper, “Before I die.”<br /><br />Then, he would wipe away a tear with curled, shaking fingers and continue.<br /><br />What follows, is the story (as accurately as I could pen it) told to me over those two days. It is the story of a young officer, caught up (and lost in) the bureaucracy of a military machine that was fresh out of World War Two, and later the Korean conflict (war). It was a military that now found itself burdened by the pressures and the threat of communism and the cold war. It was a military divided by pomp, ego, and a sense of self inflicted grandeur.<br /><br />I have changed names and a few places to protect my storyteller and hiding places now scattered around the country. Many of the places named in this book still exist (some nearly intact) and readers are welcomed to search them out. I myself have stood in a couple of the very places mentioned in these pages, and believe me, the ghosts of the past only add to the mystique.<br />Those of you who are already believers in the conspiracy that began in the New Mexico desert on that July day in nineteen forty-seven, will understand (but maybe not agree with) the moves made by our government and some of the individual players in the days, weeks, and years that followed the original crash. Some of you, who have found yourselves on the fence (not knowing whether to believe or not) may be pushed off your precarious perch (in one direction or the other).<br />My only hope is that my storyteller finds some modicum of peace in knowing that His truth is now “out there.",

            "description": "No matter how clear and well written, naked code is never quite self-documenting. There is always a role for comments, whether the in-line narration of key design points or the formal annotation of public declarations.&#xa0;Nearly every modern language, including Swift, offers some kind of structured comment system that documents APIs for developers that consume them.<br /><br />\nThe Swift structured documentation uses a mix of custom keywords and Markdown syntax to create a simple, easy-to-apply annotation tool. By leveraging this industry-standard tech, Apple opens up its structured documentation system to an entirely new generation with an absolute minimum of training needed to get up to speed.<br /><br />\nThis short book introduces Swift's documentation markup system using simple, illustrated examples, with plenty of discussion of best practices. You'll discover the components that make up Swift's structured comment system and learn how to best integrate them into your own code. For the most part, I've built this material out of examples from Swift's standard library, from release notes, and by reverse-engineering extensible style-sheet specifications. While I've tried to include a thorough list of legal tokens, I've focused on supplementing core details with a thoughtful discussion of best practices that will stand the test of time as Apple updates this system.<br /><br />\nI hope you find this book to be a useful and worthy addition to your development library. I've had a great time writing it. Hopefully you'll have a great time reading it. Thank you for purchasing a copy!<br /><br />\n-- Erica Sadun<br /><br />\n<b>What people are saying:</b><br /><br />\n\"I wish every line of #swiftlang I read in the future will be written by someone who reads the awesome [book] by @ericasadun\" -- Mark Engle, @_markengle<br /><br />\n\"Just bought @ericasadun's #swiftlang Docs Markup Book. It's great for Swift devs\" -- @Kametrixom<br /><br />\n\"Erica Sadun's new book, <i>Swift Documentation Markup, an Illustrated Tour</i>, not only explains the importance of documentation, it also comprehensively details the breadth of Xcode’s markup support...Until I read the book, I had no real idea of just how powerful this support was. In a series of clearly written sections, Erica explains how to implement features such as text formatting, category keywords and even embedded images with real world demonstrations, examples of how Apple use them and recommendations on whether they should actually be used.<br /><br />\nThe ability to add rich content to documentation means that creating code comments now feels more of a creative process and there’s a certain satisfaction to option-clicking your carefully crafted function to see a beautifully formatted comment appear. This in itself is a incentive to start documenting properly...So, thanks to Erica, expect to see a massive improvement in my own code documentation from now on.\" -- Simon Gladman, @FlexMonkey<br /><br />\n\"instapurchase!\"&#xa0; -- James O'Leary, @jpohh<br /><br />\n\"Cool book on Xcode quick help comments by @ericasadun...Oh, and did I mention the book's cover is gorgeous?\" -- @blessing_Lopes<br /><br />\n\"Every dev should have this!!!\" -- Vic Hudson, @vichudson1<br /><br />\n\"Thanks for this!\" -- Nick Kohrn, @bnkohrn",

No, the storm isn't severe enough for that and, besides, if the house had been struck you'd hear Mrs. Baggert yelling. She at that moment a woman's voice cried out, Mr. Swift! Tom! Where are you? Something dreadful has happened! There she goes!  remarked Mr. Swift, as he splashed into a mud puddle. Bless my deflection udder!suddenly cried a voice from the flat roof of the Swift house. Hello! I say, is anyone down there? Yes, we are, answered Tom. Is that you, Mr. Damon? Bless my collar button! It certainly is where's Mr. Sharp? I don't hear him. Oh, I'm here all right, answered the balloonist. I'm trying to get the airship clear of the chimney. Mr. Damon -- Yes, I steered wrong! interrupted the odd man.
